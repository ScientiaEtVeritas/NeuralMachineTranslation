for some time I have been interested in the placebo effect ,
which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , " Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . "
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what is happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a %-%
for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
and I am going to show you how it works . this is a trick that is been in every children 's magic book since at least the 1950s .
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s .
I will do it for you , and then I will explain it .
and then I will explain why I explained it .
so , here is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
I am just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
I will get my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I am just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as I am squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
I am going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife .
in fact it is held so tightly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . and you can examine everything .
ta - da !
so , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very %-% even though it is a very simple trick methodologically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this . I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I am going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
the reason I am holding onto my wrist is because that is actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as I move around my finger shifts .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don 't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn 't count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that is not really what this is about . right ? and then I open my hand up .
obviously it is clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
and then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . you give the knife out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
I am not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that is like aspirin shaped %-% it is just a round white pill %-% it has some certain measurable effect .
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical %-% they are sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really flipped me out .
turns out though , that that is not even where it stops .
if you have capsules , they are more effective than tablets in any form .
a colored capsule , that is yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
dosage has something to do with this .
one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills %-% I don 't remember the statistic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these dosages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you have go to the needle .
right ? a syringe with some inert %-% a couple CCs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind ,
it is so much stronger than the white pill .
it is a really , this graph , well I will show it to you some other time when we have slides .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality ,
it is only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
this is a seven - inch hatpin . it is very , very sharp ,
and I am going to just sterilize it a tiny bit .
this is really my flesh . this is not Damian 's special - grown flesh .
that is my skin right there . this is not a Hollywood special effect .
I am going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
if you are queasy %-% if you faint easily %-% I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn 't know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 %-%
in fact , you know what , I will do the first bad part behind it .
you will get to see , you can look away too if you would like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce .
I am sorry , man . am I freaking you out ?
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we are in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
sort of .
but you can 't count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that is one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ... I know what people think when they see this .
they go , " Well , he is certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little peek .
how 's that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , I know . and the people in the back go , " OK , I didn 't really see that . "
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a Hollywood special effect .
that is my flesh , and I can twist that around .
I am sorry . if you are getting queasy , look away , don 't look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , " Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be %-% see there is a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , I would take the needle out .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wounds .
but I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I am just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you are looking forward to that . thank you very much .
while writing an article for Italian Wired .
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I am writing anything , but I would already finished editing the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word " disabled " to see what I would find .
let me read you the entry .
" disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run - down , worn - out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid - up , done - up , done - for , done - in cracked - up , counted - out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
Antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . "
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I would just gotten past " mangled , " and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
you know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus
so I am thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , needless to say , thank God I wasn 't using a thesaurus back then .
I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them ,
when in fact , today I am celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
so , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting .
here is the updated version of this entry .
unfortunately , it is not much better .
I find the last two words under " Near Antonyms , " particularly unsettling : " whole " and " wholesome . "
so , it is not just about the words .
it is what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it is about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the Greeks and the Romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who is empowered ?
by casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power .
wouldn 't we want to open doors for them instead ?
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
his name was Dr. Pizzutillo ,
an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce ,
so he went by Dr.P.
and Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands %-% different colors , you know %-% to help build up my leg muscles ,
and I hated these bands more than anything %-%
I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
and , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year - old child ,
with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session %-% exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions %-% and he said to me , " Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you are going to break one of those bands .
when you do break it , I am going to give you a hundred bucks . "
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P 's part to get me to do the exercises I didn 't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five - year - old in the second floor ward ,
but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence
into a new and promising experience for me .
and I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn 't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn 't caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them %-% not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self - identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
the human ability to adapt , it is an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I am going to make an admission : this phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people 's questions about it , and I think I am starting to figure out why .
implicit in this phrase of " overcoming adversity " is the idea that success , or happiness , unscathed or unmarked by the experience ,
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both . and I am going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity isn 't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
it is part of our life .
and I tend to think of it like my shadow .
sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there is very little , but it is always with me .
and , certainly , I am not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person 's struggle .
there is adversity and challenge in life , and it is all very real and relative to every single person ,
but the question isn 't whether or not you are going to meet adversity , but how you are going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they are not equipped to adapt .
there is an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I am disabled .
and , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability I have had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don 't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community .
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
and , most importantly , there is a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
so it is not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
so maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we are less burdened by the presence of it .
this year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character .
to paraphrase : it is not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from Darwin 's work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we are tested , we don 't know what we are made of .
maybe that is what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re - imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
adversity is just change that we haven 't adapted ourselves to yet .
I think the greatest adversity that we have created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
now , who is normal ?
there is no normal .
there is common , there is typical . there is no normal ,
and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
I don 't think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility %-% or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous %-%
we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
there is evidence that Neanderthals , 60000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it is because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community . they didn 't view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
it was summertime : I had shorts on .
I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , " Well , if it isn 't Aimee Mullins . "
and I turn around , and it is this older man . I have no idea who he is .
and I said , " I am sorry , sir , have we met ? I don 't remember meeting you . "
he said , " Well , you wouldn 't remember meeting me .
I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother 's womb . "
Oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was Dr. Kean , a man that I had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother 's prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
and , because I was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer %-% this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
he said to me , " I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you have been making liar out of me ever since . "
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
and he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will .
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone 's life .
and Dr. Kean went on to tell me , he said , " In my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . "
see , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there is a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there is been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh - and - bone legs , I wouldn 't have hesitated for a second .
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
but if you ask me today , I am not so sure .
and it is because of the experiences I have had with them , not in spite of the experiences I have had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because I have been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you are off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power %-% the human spirit is so receptive %-% if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
you are teaching them to open doors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word " educate " comes from the root word " educe . "
it means " to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . "
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 1960s Britain ,
when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .
it is called the streaming trials . we call it " tracking " here in the States .
it is separating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
and the " A students " get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three - month period , D - level students , gave them A 's ,
told them they were " A 's , " told them they were bright ,
and at the end of this three - month period , they were performing at A - level .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the " A students " and told them they were " D 's . "
and that is what happened at the end of that three - month period .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
the teachers didn 't know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , " These are the ' A - students , ' these are the ' D - students . ' "
and that is how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that is been crushed doesn 't have hope ,
it doesn 't see beauty ,
it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity
and our innate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
I would like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth - century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend , Jacques Dembois told me about ,
and the poem is called " The God Who Only knows Four Words " :
" every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don 'ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , ' Come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . ' "
thank you .
so , I have known a lot of fish in my life .
I have loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm - raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if I would speak at an event about the farm 's sustainability .
" absolutely , " I said .
here was a company trying to solve what is become this unimaginable problem for us chefs :
how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we have been fishing the seas like we clear - cut forests .
it is hard to overstate the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love %-% the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish %-% they have collapsed .
there is almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it :
fish farms pollute %-% most of them do anyway %-% and they are inefficient . take tuna ,
a major drawback .
it is got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
the day before the event , I called the head of P.R. for the company .
let us call him Don .
" Don , " I said , " just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don 't pollute . "
" that is right , " he said . " we are so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . "
and then he added , " We are basically a world unto ourselves .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2 point 5 to one , " he said .
" best in the business . "
2 point 5 to one , great .
" 2 point 5 what ? what are you feeding ? "
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
" great , " I said . got off the phone .
and that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , " Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? "
he said he didn 't know . he would ask around .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ;
no one could give me a straight answer
until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
let us call him Don too .
" Don , " I said , " what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? "
well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
I said , " Chicken pellets ? "
he said , " Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . "
I said , " What percentage of your feed is chicken ? " thinking , you know , two percent .
" well , it is about 30 percent , " he said .
I said , " Don , what is sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? "
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , " There is just too much chicken in the world . "
I fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because I am some self - righteous , goody - two shoes foodie .
I actually am .
no , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
this second fish , it is a different kind of love story .
it is the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
the chef had overcooked it .
like twice over .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste good after it is been overcooked ?
I can 't , but this guy can .
let us call him Miguel %-%
actually his name is Miguel .
and no , he didn 't cook the fish , and he is not a chef ,
at least in the way that you and I understand it .
he is a biologist at Veta La Palma .
it is a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
it is at the tip of the Guadalquivir river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
they did it by draining the land .
they built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn 't make it work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
what did they do ?
they reversed the flow of water .
they literally flipped the switch .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
they flooded the canals .
they created a 27000 - acre fish farm %-% bass , mullet , shrimp , eel %-% and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm 's incredible .
I mean , you have never seen anything like this .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
I was there not long ago with Miguel .
he is an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee .
okay ? there we are slogging through the wetlands , and I am panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel 's calmly conducting a biology lecture .
here , he is pointing out a rare Black - shouldered Kite .
now , he is mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , " Fish ? I didn 't know anything about fish .
I am an expert in relationships . "
and then he is off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
and don 't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing .
it is great , but I was in love .
and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
so I interrupted him . I said , " Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? "
he pointed at the algae .
" I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : it is amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what is the feed conversion ratio ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it is such a rich system that the fish are eating what they would be eating in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it is what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it is totally self - renewing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn 't feed its animals ?
later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , " For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I would ever been at , how do you measure success ? "
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
" that is success , " he said .
" look at their bellies , pink .
they are feasting . "
feasting ? I was totally confused .
I said , " Miguel , aren 't they feasting on your fish ? "
" yes , " he said .
" we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 600000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it is become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . "
I said , " Miguel , isn 't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? "
he shook his head , no .
he said , " We farm extensively , not intensively .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the Pinker the belly , the better the system . "
okay , so let us review :
a farm that doesn 't feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn 't even be there in the first place .
they brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they are able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 .
no kidding .
I was imagining a " March of the Penguins " thing , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , " Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? "
he looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song .
he said , " No ; they do it because the food 's better . "
I didn 't mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious %-% and I don 't like fish skin ;
I don 't like it seared , I don 't like it crispy .
it is that acrid , tar - like flavor .
I almost never cook with it .
yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
it tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded .
he said , " The skin acts like a sponge .
it is the last defense before anything enters the body .
it evolved to soak up impurities . "
and then he added , " But our water has no impurities . "
OK . a farm that doesn 't feed its fish ,
a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
and then I realized when he says , " A farm that has no impurities , " he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
it is a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn 't feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that is literally a water purification plant %-% and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I will take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
you might say it is a recipe for the future of good food , whether we are talking about bass or beef cattle .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
but for a lot people , that is a bit too radical .
we are not realists , us foodies ;
we are lovers .
we love farmers ' markets ,
we love small family farms ,
we talk about local food ,
we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , " Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? "
how are you going to feed the world ?
can I be honest ?
I don 't love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hungry today .
one billion %-% that is more than ever before %-% because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
now , I don 't love this question because it is determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , " If we are feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? "
that is been the motivation ,
it is been the justification :
it is been the business plan of American agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that is quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
that is not a business , and it isn 't agriculture .
our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources . not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let us start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don 't look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it is really old , and it is tired .
it is high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it is never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let us look to the ecological model .
that is the one that relies on two billion years Look to Miguel , farmers like Miguel . farms that aren 't worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships . because they are the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
and if I am going to be really honest , they are a better chef than I will ever be .
you know , I am okay with that , because if that is the future of good food , it is going to be delicious .
thank you .
one day , Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an African - American man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and I am telling a story that many of you know , because Steve 's columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the Juilliard - trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental %-% if you will pardon the pun %-% in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
he had just heard a performance of Beethoven 's First and Fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo - Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series ,
all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven 's Fourth Symphony .
and we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes ,
the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall %-%
he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
so , I just started playing .
and I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
and as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel 's eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and Nathaniel 's manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete %-% Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius .
and we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B 's , from Bartók , all the way up to ESA - Pekka Salonen .
and I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , Juilliard - trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for Nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
and I understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we are able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for Nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we are at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : thank you . thanks .

Robert Gupta : I am going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists .
so , please forgive me .
several years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
and the idea 's pretty simple :
teams of four have to build the tallest free - standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it is actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
and so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , I have conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there is something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I would like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it is going to look like , they Jockey for power . then they spend some time planning , organizing ,
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever - growing structures . and then finally , just as they are running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and %-% ta - da ! %-%
they admire their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the " ta - da " turns into an " uh - oh , " because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more " uh - oh " moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
they lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more " ta - da " structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
and it is pretty amazing .
as Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they are the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of spaghetti , Inc . right ?
they don 't spend time jockeying for power .
but there is another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they execute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it is a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn 't work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let us look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
thirty - nine inches is the tallest structure I have seen .
and why is it ? because they understand triangles and self - reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so CEOs , a little bit better than average ,
but here is where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
it is incredible . you know , you look around , you go , " Oh , that team 's going to win . "
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of facilitation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team 's performance .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you will get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and I tried something interesting .
I thought , let us up the ante , once .
so I offered a 10000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here is what happened :
not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn 't that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
so there is deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
and the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn 't it ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language ,
a common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
it is a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
there is step - by - step instructions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
and the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an " uh - oh " moment to a " ta - da " moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody count the number of books with " happiness " in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we are just as messed up as anybody else is .
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word " happiness " is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we will have to give up and we will have to adopt the more complicated view of what well - being is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it is between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they are both lumped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it is the unfortunate fact that we can 't think about any circumstance that affects well - being without distorting its importance .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there is just no way of getting it right .
now , I would like to start with an example of somebody who had a question - and - answer session after one of my lectures reported a story ,
he said he would been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
but it hadn 't .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re - living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it is the experiencing self that the doctor approaches %-% you know , when the doctor asks , " Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? "
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it is the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , " How have you been feeling lately ? "
or " How was your trip to Albania ? " or something like that .
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories %-% it starts immediately .
we don 't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
I won 't go into detail . it is no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients ,
those are their recordings .
and you are asked , " Who of them suffered more ? "
and it is a very easy question .
clearly , Patient B suffered more %-%
his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more .
but now there is another question : " how much did these patients think they suffered ? "
and here is a surprise . the surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great %-% but one of them is this distinct ... but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ;
it is a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , " How bad was the whole thing , in total ? " and it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work %-% you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
what defines a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it is also true of the stories that we make up .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really straightforward :
they are lost forever .
I mean , most of the moments of our life %-% and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ;
that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ;
in a month , there are about 600000 %-%
most of them don 't leave a trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it is the finite resource that we are spending while we are on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they are really quite distinct .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two - week vacation is twice as good as the one - week vacation .
that is not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
for the remembering self , a two - week vacation is barely better than the one - week vacation because there are no new memories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ;
time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that is the surgeon that will be chosen .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don 't choose between experiences ,
we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don 't think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn 't need .
I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , in the service of our remembering self .
and this is a bit hard to justify I think .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
and when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I have ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vacations .
and I probably have consumed my memories of that three - week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question :
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so I want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you will get an amnesic drug so that you won 't remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ? and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it is actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer ,
and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self 's life ?
and they are all %-% happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it is a completely different thing .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn 't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well - being , who have been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
the Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences ,
and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn 't teach you much about how happily they are living their life , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , " Oh his father is six feet tall , " how much would you know about his height ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there is a lot of uncertainty .
you have that much uncertainty .
if I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what I have said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well - being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .
and what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up %-% some people may end up moving to California .
and it is sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they will be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio ,
and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well - being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : thank you . I have got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
Daniel Kahneman : sure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60000 dollars a year , for Americans %-% and that is a very large sample of Americans , like 600000 , so it is a large representative sample %-% below an income of 600000 dollars a year ... CA : 60000 .
DK : 60000 .
60000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean I have rarely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
CA : but Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
DK : you know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.K. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it is going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
this is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
in the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
CA : well , it seems to me that this issue will %-% or at least should be %-% the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you , Danny Kahneman .
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
in high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
and you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn 't in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking " samples " %-% frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water %-% and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
you know , I was a real science geek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late ' 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and I was an artist .
I could draw . I could paint .
and I found that because there weren 't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author 's description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
that was %-% the creativity And an interesting thing happened : the Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday %-%
that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
but that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
so , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
but I didn 't let that daunt me .
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
and I didn 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , I have spent about 3000 hours underwater ,
and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
and I have learned that that deep - ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature 's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when I chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
and I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : " Terminator , " " Aliens " and " The Abyss . "
and with " The Abyss , " I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
something interesting came out of " The Abyss , " which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .
and this resulted in the first soft - surface character , CG animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn 't make any money %-% barely broke even , I should say %-% I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
you know , it is Arthur Clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
they were seeing something magical .
and so that got me very excited .
and I thought , " Wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . "
so , with " Terminator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much farther .
working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude
in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again ,
and we had the same result with an audience %-%
although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , " This is going to be a whole new world , " this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , I started a company with Stan Winston , my good friend Stan Winston , who is the premier make - up and creature designer
and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid ' 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
so , I wrote this piece called " Avatar , " which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG ,
and the main characters would all be in CG ,
and the world would be in CG .
and the envelope pushed back ,
and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren 't going to be able to do this for a while .
so , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
you know , I went and pitched it to the studio as " ' Romeo and Juliet ' on a ship :
" it is going to be this epic romance , passionate film . "
secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of " Titanic . "
and that is why I made the movie .
and that is the truth . now , the studio didn 't know that .
but I convinced them . I said , " We are going to dive to the wreck . we are going to film it for real .
we will be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . "
and I talked them into funding an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port .
not a movie , not HD %-% for real .
now , that blew my mind .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it struck me how much was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can 't get back by yourself .
and I thought like , " Wow . I am like , living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . "
and so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep - ocean exploration .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it %-%
it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn 't give me .
because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but I couldn 't imagine what I was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
so , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
and so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of " Titanic , " I said , " OK , I am going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I am going to go be a full - time explorer for a while . "
and so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we wound up going to the Bismark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the Titanic wreck .
we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn 't have the means to do it ,
so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
and I am flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
when I say , " I am operating it , " but my mind is in the vehicle .
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I have ever had ,
because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the telepresence experience %-% that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound . and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post - human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals %-%
they are basically aliens right here on Earth .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
they don 't survive on sunlight - based system the way we do .
and so , you are seeing animals that are living next to a 500 - degree - Centigrade water plumes . you think they can 't possibly exist .
at the same time again , it is the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions ,
going to Russia , going through the pre - cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access %-% astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments %-%
taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I would completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . but I also learned a lot about leadership .
now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn 't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , " What am I doing out here ?
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? "
we don 't make money at these damn shows .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
people sort of think I went away between " Titanic " and " Avatar " and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
you are doing it for the task itself , for the challenge %-% and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is %-%
for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time ,
sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you have done a task that you can 't explain to someone else .
when you come back to the shore and you say , " We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human - performance aspects of working at sea , " you can 't explain it to people . it is that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when I came back to make my next movie , which was " Avatar , " I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory ,
doing " Avatar , " coming up with new technology that didn 't exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four - and - half year period .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , people have commented on how , " Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora . "
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , I think number one is curiosity .
it is the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
I have young filmmakers come up to me and say , " Give me some advice for doing this . "
and I say , " Don 't put limitations on yourself .
other people will do that for you %-% don 't do it to yourself , don 't bet against yourself ,
and take risks . "
NASA has this phrase that they like : " failure is not an option . "
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it is a leap of faith .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that is the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you are doing ,
failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
let us pretend right here we have a machine . a big machine , a cool , TED - ish machine , and it is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are . and I wonder what you would choose , because I have been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
I don 't know . they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or " American Idol . "
I don 't know .
I am convinced that there is some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and I understand that .
I am not part of that crowd , I have to say .
I don 't want to go back , and it is not because I am adventurous . it is because possibilities on this planet , they don 't go back , they go forward .
so I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there is ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease ...
there is never been a time like this .
my great - grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it is not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it is an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it is gone . it is vanished .
we vanquished it . puff .
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method %-% trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn 't %-% is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
so that is the good news .
unfortunately , that is all the good news because there are some other problems , and they have been mentioned many times . and one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
that number 's rising , and it is rising really rapidly , and it is disgraceful .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they are going away , and they are going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we are going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and I think we can .
I think it is clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn 't also destroy it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain 't wishful thinking .
but here is the thing that keeps me up at night %-% one of the things that keeps me up at night :
we have never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never . and we have also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
we are on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields ,
and yet I actually think we would have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the Enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can 't set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone 's entitled to their opinion ; they are even entitled to their opinion about progress . but you know what you are not entitled to ?
you are not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you are not .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
about a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . a little story .
and I was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
I didn 't know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
and soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn 't understand why people thought this was " Frankenfoods , " why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature 's ground .
but , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I am a journalist . we type , we file , we go to dinner . it is fine .
but these stories bothered me , and I couldn 't figure out why , and eventually I did .
and that is because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren 't actually fanatics at all .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just disturbed me so much .
but then I thought , you know , let us be honest . we are at a point in this world where we don 't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambivalently .
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : " progress . "
okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
we have lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there is no reason we shouldn 't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , hanging chads .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right ,
so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
Don 't take anything for granted .
but here is the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we are not that good at doing that .
and the reason that I can say that is because we are now in an epidemic of fear like one I have never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it is a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn 't matter . it doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don 't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous . disastrous because here is a fact : the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it is horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
doesn 't happen very much .
doesn 't happen in this country at all , but it happened 160000 times in the world last year .
that is a lot of death of measles %-% 20 an hour .
but since it didn 't happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like " Oprah " and " Larry King Live . "
and they can do it because they don 't link causation and correlation .
they don 't understand that these things seem the same , but they are almost never the same .
and it is something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
no fear , no agony . polio %-% puff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is Paul Offit .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it will save the lives of 400 to 500000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it is good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , Paul 's a terrorist .
when Paul speaks in a public hearing , he can 't testify without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because Paul made a vaccine .
I don 't need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that is happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it is getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it is just a numbers game .
and they are not just going to die of measles .
what about polio ? let us have that . why not ?
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident .
no one 's ever said that before .
she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio ,
no way .
fine .
why ? because we don 't have polio . and you know what ?
we didn 't have polio in this country yesterday .
today , I don 't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he is flying to LAX , right now he is over Ohio .
and he is going to land in a couple of hours , he is going to rent a car , and he is going to come to Long Beach , and he is going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight .
and he doesn 't know that he is infected with a paralytic disease , and we don 't either because that is the way the world works .
that is the planet we live on . Don 't pretend it isn 't .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
Echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn 't matter how often we find out that they are useless .
the data says it all the time .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
it is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
I am totally with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma .
we hate Big Government . we don 't trust the Man .
and we shouldn 't : our health care system sucks .
it is cruel to millions of people .
it is absolutely astonishingly cold and soul - bending to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we leap into the arms of Big placebo .
that is fantastic . I love Big placebo .
but , you know , it is really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and I have all sorts of little props here .
none of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai %-% I don 't even know what that is but we are spending billions of dollars on it %-% it is fraud .
and you know what ? when I say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , " What do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . "
and you know what ? you are wrong .
because I don 't care if it is the secretary of HHS who is saying , " Hmm , I am not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , " or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don 't want to be .
you end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa .
he killed 400000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
please , don 't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mindless epidemic we are in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
it is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it is a debate about words , about metaphors .
it is ideology , it is not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sprig of parsley , every Brussels sprout has been modified by man .
you know , there weren 't tangerines in the garden of Eden .
there wasn 't any cantaloupe .
there weren 't Christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 11000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn 't .
we got rid of the stuff that didn 't .
now we can do it in a more precise way %-%
and there are risks , absolutely %-%
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
you don 't want to do that ?
I have to say , I don 't understand it .
we object to genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things I constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don 't want giant fields of the same thing , that is wrong .
we don 't companies patenting life .
we don 't want companies owning seeds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you are right . let us fix it .
it is true , we have got a huge food problem , but this isn 't science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it is law , it is morality , it is patent stuff .
you know science isn 't a company .
it is not a country .
it is not even an idea ; it is a process .
it is a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we are afraid , is really very deadening , and it is preventing millions of people from prospering .
you know , in the next 50 years we are going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now ,
70 percent .
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
Disgraceful . Disgraceful .
they need it , and we are not giving it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don 't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
cassava 's something that half a billion people eat .
it is kind of like a potato .
it is just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
it doesn 't have nutrients , it doesn 't have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they would be able to not go blind .
they wouldn 't starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn 't be Chez Panisse , but it would be nice .
and all I can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
I mean , let us ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don 't want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it is not about chemicals .
it is not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food .
this isn 't about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it is about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don 't , if we continue to act the way we are acting , we are guilty of something that I don 't think we want to be guilty of : high - tech colonialism .
there is no other way to describe what is going on here .
it is selfish , it is ugly , it is beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , " So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? "
absolutely . absolutely , I do .
it is stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we are going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we are going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I am concerned , that is something the world needs right now .
thank you . thank you .
I am going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full - time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people %-% in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won 't grow :
there will be too much rain , not enough rain ,
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can 't support .
and that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
the coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we have seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that is why we have refrigerators , air - conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheaper %-% and let us go for making it twice as cheap %-% we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one .
if you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects :
the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can 't adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are , there is some uncertainty there , but not very much .
and there is certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be ,
but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can 't we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that is a big challenge .
it is very different than saying " We are a twelve - foot - high truck trying to get under a ten - foot bridge ,
and we can just sort of squeeze under . "
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each American , it is about 20 tons ;
for people in poor countries , it is less than one ton .
it is an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it is been constantly going up .
it is only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equation has four factors ,
a little bit of multiplication :
so , you have got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that is going to be based on the number of people , the services each person 's using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let us look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that is back from high school algebra , but let us take a look .
first , we have got population .
the world today has 6 point 8 billion people . that is headed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1 point 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this encompasses everything : the food we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it is a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
here we have a very basic service :
do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
and , in fact , these kids don 't , so they are going out and reading their school work under the street lamps .
now , efficiency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that is not going up . through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings %-% there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially .
some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fertilizer , where the rooms for improvement are far , far less .
and so , overall here , if we are optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we have gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons ,
and that just won 't cut it .
so let us look at this fourth factor %-% this is going to be a key one %-% and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
and so , what we are going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy miracles .
now , when I use the term " miracle , " I don 't mean something that is impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the Internet and its services are a miracle .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don 't have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don 't .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline .
now , I thought , " How could I really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people 's imagination here ? "
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
I am told they don 't bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
now , there is all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one , but they don 't really add up to much .
we need solutions %-% either one or several %-% that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability ,
and , although there is many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
I have left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we are going to have to work on each of these five , and we can 't give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
let us look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it is not ,
and that is to take all the CO2 , after you have burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky ,
and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard ,
but the toughest one here is this long - term issue .
who is going to be sure ?
who is going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that is a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems :
cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ;
the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn 't get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it is not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
people need to feel good about it . so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , I have grouped together .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and they actually %-% although it is great they don 't require fuel %-% they have some disadvantages .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy farming , so you are talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are intermittent sources . the sun doesn 't shine all day , it doesn 't shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn 't blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it is not available .
so , we have got big cost challenges here ,
we have transmission challenges :
for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
and , finally , this storage problem .
and , to dimensionalize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made %-% for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything %-%
and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses ,
and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now .
it is not impossible , but it is not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you are using .
if you are counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , how we are going to go forward on this %-% what is the right approach ?
is it a Manhattan Project ? what is the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you will look at and say , " They are crazy . " that is good .
and , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
Vinod Khosla 's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I am trying to help back that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there is some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of TerraPower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium %-% the one percent , which is the U235 %-% we decided , " Let us burn the 99 percent , the U238 . "
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it is through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material 's approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you are burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today 's reactors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it is a great thing .
it breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it is kind of like a candle .
you can see it is a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
I have got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
this is the leftover , the 99 percent ,
where they have taken out the part they burn now , so it is called depleted uranium .
that would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you would have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it is got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let us think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let us go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
for 2050 , you have heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture ,
hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , So , the other grade is : are we deploying this zero - emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we are in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that is super important .
that is a key element of making that report card .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions :
the less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don 't get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
there is a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the Al Gore book , " Our Choice " and the David McKay book , " Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . "
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly , because we need broad backing for this .
there is a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it is a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years %-% I could pick who is president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that is half the cost with no CO2 gets invented %-%
this is the wish I would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don 't get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich ,
and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am I appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn 't just discuss the CO2 .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you would be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
we do need the market incentives %-% CO2 tax , cap and trade %-% something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about TerraPower , right %-% I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
Bil Gates : to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we have done , that is only tens of millions ,
and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you will only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it is just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
CA : and so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
BG : that is right . today , you are always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong :
that thing where you are opening it up and moving things in and out ,
that is not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in %-% just think of it as a log %-% put it down and not have those same complexities .
and it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it is done .
CA : it is a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
BG : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there %-% there is a lot less waste under this approach %-% then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that is sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors %-%
that is our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that is been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you are reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically CA : I mean , you are talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here . where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
BG : well , we haven 't picked a particular place , and there is all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that is called " nuclear , "
so we have got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China %-%
I have been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
so I am optimistic . you know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
it is an important advance , but it is like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who is done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
CA : so , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
BG : well , we need %-% for one of these high - scale , electro - generation things that is very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
that is sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , TerraPower , if things go well %-% which is wishing for a lot %-% could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies %-% we need it to be hundreds %-% who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
and it is best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succeed .
CA : in terms of big - scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you are aware of out there ?
BG : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
you know , we don 't know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that is a different approach .
there is a liquid - type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so %-% if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation %-% the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
CA : if this doesn 't work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
BG : if you get into that situation , it is like if you have been over - eating , and you are about to have a heart attack :
then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what is called geoengineering , which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that is just an insurance policy .
you hope you don 't need to do that .
some people say you shouldn 't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you will keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
I am not sure that is wise , given the importance of the problem , but there is now the geoengineering discussion about %-% should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
CA : climate skeptics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they are wrong ?
BG : well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying that there is negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there is a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it is kind of like AIDS .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing %-%
in fact , the IPCC report , that is not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , " OK , that isn 't that big of a deal . "
the fact is it is that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skeptics say , " OK , I don 't care that it doesn 't put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I will accept it because it is cheaper than what is come before . "
CA : and so , that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it is going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it is a stupid waste of the Earth 's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
BG : well , the actual spending on the R " D piece %-% say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now %-% it is not that dramatic .
it shouldn 't take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that is non - economic and you are trying to fund that %-%
that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you are very close and you are just funding the learning curve and it is going to get very cheap ,
I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the trade - off you get into is , " Let us make energy super expensive , " then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even Lomborg has changed .
his shtick now is , " Why isn 't the R " D getting more discussed ? "
he is still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skeptic camp , but he is realized that is a pretty lonely camp , and so , he is making the R " D point .
and so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
the R " D piece , it is crazy how little it is funded .
CA : well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
BG : thank you .
if I can leave you with one big idea today , it is that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what I would like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we are looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that I am using here is a little experiment .
it is called pivot , and with pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths %-% say , accidents .
and , right away , I see there is a different pattern that emerges .
this is because , in the mid - area here , people are at their most active , and over here they are at their most frail .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age %-% say 40 years or less %-% we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you drill into that , it is especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info - graphic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced .
it is all here ; it is all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
you can drill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so I am looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
I am a Lance Armstrong fan , so I will go ahead and I will click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which Lance Armstrong 's been a part of .
now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , " Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? "
so I can step back , and expand on that .
and I see Greg LeMond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way %-% going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out %-% you are not searching , you are not browsing .
you are doing something that is actually a little bit different .
it is in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that is a little bit crazy .
what we are done here is we have taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
so the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
I am only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I am going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .
it is only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ;
some have come from natural sciences ;
some , fewer still , have come from business %-%
there is my boss %-%
and one has come from music .
and interestingly enough , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
so you see , we are navigating the web for the first time as if it is actually a web , not from page - to - page , And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
I am just showing the New York Times website here .
so pivot , this application %-% I don 't want to call it a browser ; it is really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it %-% and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
so I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
so I can drill into what I have done over specific time frames .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
and I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
and , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history %-%
here , I was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for Bing , over here for Live Labs pivot .
and from these , I can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
it is one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
we talk about drowning in data .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there is wisdom to be found .
