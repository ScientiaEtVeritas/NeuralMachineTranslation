I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships .
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects %-% along with my adviser Pattie , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi %-% I started to wonder %-% what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop ,
what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ?
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Siftables .
in a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
they are able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
most importantly , they are physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
and Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles .
so , I am going to start with some simple examples .
this Siftable is configured to show video , and if I tilt it in one direction , it will roll the video this way ; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
so if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we have got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here I am %-%
this is a Fibonacci sequence that I am making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that is kind of like a mash - up between Scrabble and Boggle .
basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab ,
and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , " Make words , " and they know exactly what to do .
so here is another few people trying it out .
that is our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
and this is Felix , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he is bringing the sun out .
video : the sun is rising . David Merrill : now he is brought a tractor into the scene .
video : the orange tractor . good job ! yeah !
DM : so by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact %-%
video : Woof ! DM : inventing his own narrative .
video : Hello ! DM : it is an open - ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
video : fly away , cat . DM : so , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we have built recently , in which Siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
and you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable .
there are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let us have a look .
video : DM : we will start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
now I put a bass line in .
video : DM : now I will put some percussion in .
video : DM : and now I will attach the filter to the drums , so I can control the effect live .
video : DM : I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other .
video : DM : and now I will attach the filter to the bass for some more expression .
video : DM : I can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
so I don 't have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
and now , finally , I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable , tilted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human - computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we are working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought I want to leave you with is that we are on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much . I look forward to talking with all of you .
you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways ,
who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
we are all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initiation rites .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn 't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what is interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara %-%
this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago %-%
or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well - being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere ,
and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is humanity 's great legacy .
it is the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
and just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere %-% and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true ,
and yet that %-% the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity %-% scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6000 languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it is a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an old - growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
they are no longer being taught to babies ,
which means , effectively , unless something changes , they are already dead .
what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
and I know there is some of you who say , " Well , wouldn 't it be better ,
wouldn 't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? " and I say , " Great , let us make that language Yoruba . let us make it Cantonese .
let us make it Kogi . "
and you will suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
and so , what I would like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say " different ways of being , " I really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called " linguistic exogamy : " you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
and this is all rooted in the mythological past ,
yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures ,
forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two - dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
but the Waorani didn 't just spear outsiders .
they speared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
we traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . but at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early ' 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier 's strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . and Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
on the contrary , it is a complex metaphysical worldview .
it is interesting .
if I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
there is always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub - Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
but , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
that is why the Voodooists like to say that " You white people go to church and speak about God .
we dance in the temple and become God . "
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit %-%
how can you be harmed ?
so you see these astonishing demonstrations : voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
now , of all the peoples that I have ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
in a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
to this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years :
two nine - year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother 's womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society ,
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic %-% or we might say the ecological %-% balance .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they are suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . and the priest steps back and says , " You see ? it is really as I have told you .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . "
they call themselves the " elder brothers " and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the " noble savage , " which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
there is not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional Mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self - consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the Andes who is raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
whether it is the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
what is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the crooked beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
it is a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman 's repertoire .
what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . it is made really of two different sources :
on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta - carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic %-%
to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness %-% but it is mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
this plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5 - methoxydimethyltryptamine .
if you have ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
to have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . it doesn 't create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
in fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes %-% who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s %-%
I used to argue that you couldn 't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you are under the effects there is no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . but the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they are denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
they can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
now , the fascinating things are that the beta - carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a flora of 80000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great euphemism , " trial and error , " which is exposed to be meaningless .
but you ask the Indians , and they say , " The plants talk to us . "
well , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , " I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don 't you know anything ? " and I said , " No . "
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
now , that is not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it is a lot more interesting than counting stamens .
now %-% -% the problem %-% the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity
on the planet . now , the problem isn 't change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
it is not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . it is power ,
the crude face of domination .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ;
these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to :
whether it is the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan %-% a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak %-% a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt to the South China Sea ,
where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest %-%
or , in the case of the Yanomami , it is the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I am doing a lot of research recently , you will see it is a crude face of political domination .
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people 's way of life , is not only not condemned , it is universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once travelled 6000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about :
6000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes ,
1 point 2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
this young man 's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
that meant he was instantly killed His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn 't bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
one day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice :
do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
and it is humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for [ 150000 ] years .
the neolithic Revolution %-% which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus %-% is only 10000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
now , that shallow history doesn 't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10000 different voices .
and it is within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
this is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people ,
and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
the Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
this old man 's grandfather refused to go .
the family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ;
they took advantage of it .
the runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
so , this man 's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
he simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . and as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
he put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
talk about getting by with nothing . and this , in many ways %-% -% is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
the Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
it is our new homeland . it is called Nunavut .
it is an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
an amazing example of how a nation - state can seek restitution with its people .
and finally , in the end , I think it is pretty obvious at least to all of all us who have traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they are not remote at all .
they are homelands of somebody .
they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
so , what we are trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
we think that polemics %-% -% we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
156 nations carry our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and what we are doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we are going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled
by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well - being .
thank you very much .
you know , I have talked about some of these projects before %-% about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
we are actually starting at a new point : we have been digitizing biology , and now we are trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
so , we have always been trying to ask big questions .
" what is life ? " is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we have tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
we have been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ;
when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we are trying to ask , " Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
this is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self - replicate in the laboratory ,
and we have been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we are able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its metabolic map , it is relatively simple compared to ours %-%
trust me , this is simple %-%
but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it is very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we have never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing ,
and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA %-% 30 to 50 letters in length %-% and it is a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174 .
it is a small virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
they laughed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger :
we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome %-%
it is over 580000 letters of genetic code %-%
so we thought we would build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you are starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10000 base pairs .
we actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50 - letter pieces to build smaller subunits We design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
think of this : we have a four - letter genetic code %-% A , C , G and T.
Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there is a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ;
there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5000 to 7000 letters , put those together to make 24000 - letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we are trying to create a process that is extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we are trying to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100000 base pairs , they won 't any longer grow readily in E. coli %-%
it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology %-%
and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew there is a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here is an example of it :
there is an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
here is an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ;
yeast puts them together automatically .
this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
it is such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures over about a six - second period .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
this is over 580000 letters of genetic code ;
it is the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it is over 300 million molecular weight .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
obviously , with a virus it is pretty simple ;
it is much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it is also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that is what you have all heard about with cloning .
with bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species %-%
roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice %-%
we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome ,
we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins ,
and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell %-% and you will appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here . the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA .
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it is exactly what we had transferred in .
so , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
now I have argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution . and I have argued that we are about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , where there is massive new speciation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we are about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : I was born in 1946 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there will be four .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it is going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion - plus barrels of oil %-%
that is a hundred million barrels a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it is going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there is all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we are limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we are calling combinatorial genomics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it is just standard selection :
we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we are working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer . you know , we don 't know necessarily what it will look like :
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we are focusing on now fourth - generation fuels .
you have seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
we have second -% and third - generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher - value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock , and so we are working with designing cells to go down this road . and we think we will have the first fourth - generation fuels in about 18 months .
sunlight and CO2 is one method ... but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling - water temperatures .
it takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we are looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of " What is life ? "
we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol - chemical industry %-%
yeah . if you can 't do that at TED , where can you ? %-%
become a major source of energy ...
but also , we are now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you have seen this year with flu ; we are always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
here is what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes .
we are a ways away from improving people :
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren 't there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted %-% 27 kilometers in circumference .
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it is nothing if not ambitious .
this is the machine below Geneva .
we take the pictures of those mini - Big Bangs inside detectors .
this is the one I work on . it is called the ATLAS detector %-% 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by ATLAS .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
it is a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
in other words , when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph .
I don 't know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here %-% these gold wires . those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , " No they don 't . they are small wires . "
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what is called superconducting wire .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
in one of the joints between over 9000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect .
so the wire heated up slightly , and its 13000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that is more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets . we had to take them out , which we did .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
they are all on their way back underground now .
by the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it is easy to refute .
I think that the fact that it is so difficult , the fact that we are overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege 's useless experiments %-% his protege was Michael Faraday %-% said this , " Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . "
thank you .
last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn 't show the thickness of the ice .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
the next slide I show you will be a rapid fast - forward of what is happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue %-%
that is the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
the so - called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here .
in 25 years it is gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
already in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
video : Whoa ! Al Gore : she is okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north .
this is an annual melting river .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
this is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level rises this is where it reaches the sea .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west Antarctica cropped up on top some under - sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
that is equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland .
in the Himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
in the Andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the flows have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
and the predictions , as you have read , are serious .
this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we have added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours %-% 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific , from the Americas , extending westward , and on either side of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the United States is one of the two largest emitters , along with China .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we are beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
that image reminded me of something .
around Christmas , in my home in Tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
this happened around Christmas .
one of the coal industry 's ads around Christmas was this one .
video : ♪ ♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .
he is abundant here in America , and he helps our economy grow .
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
he is affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
Al Gore : this is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal .
video : Don Blankenship : let me be clear about it . Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , they don 't know what they are talking about .
Al Gore : so the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
video : actor : at COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that is why we have made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn 't dirty .
we think it is clean %-% smells good , too . so don 't worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
video : actor : clean coal %-% you have heard a lot about it .
so let us take a tour of this state - of - the - art clean coal facility .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
but that is the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today 's clean coal technology .
Al Gore : finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
video : narrator : America is in crisis %-% the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years . a plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
Repower America . find out more .
Al Gore : this is the last one .
video : narrator : it is about repowering America .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
man : future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
man 2 : new investments to create high - paying jobs .
narrator : Repower America . it is time to get real .
Al Gore : there is an old African proverb that says , " If you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . "
we need to go far , quickly .
